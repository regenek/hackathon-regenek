# Hackathon Instructions

## Welcome

Awesome that you're on board the hackathon. We've compiled all the repos from the [copilot-workshops page](https://github.com/copilot-workshops) into a single repository for your convencience. You will find detailed instructions for all the exercises within each challenge's subfolder under `.instructions/`.

## The goal

The goal is for you to get started using generative AI for your daily coding tasks. This repo is supposed to be an easy way for you to do so. You will form small groups and try working on all tasks. Try to explore and play around with ChatGPT, Copilot and Copilot Chat as much as you can.

## Turning in the results

When you as a team are done, please commit your changes, push to a separate repository on Github and send the link to the coaches and/or moderators. You don't have to finish all exercises. This is not a competition, but rather a way to foster discussions as well as share learnings and experiences.

## Prerequisites

In order to easily get started with all of the assignments you will need:

- Access to Github Copilot X
- Visual Studio Code
- Copilot Nightly Extension for Visual Studio Code
- Authenticate the Extension with your Github Account
- [node and npm installed](https://nodejs.org/en)
- Python 3
- Ideally [tfsec](https://github.com/aquasecurity/tfsec), although only needed for one exercise

## Getting started

Clone this repository and start working on the assigments. Start with whatever you like best.
